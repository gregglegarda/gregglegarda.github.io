													<b>Medical Education and Training Campus</b>
													<p class="submeta">Fort Sam Houston, Texas</p>
													<p>
														Medical Education and Training Campus (METC) is the result of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission legislation that required the bulk of enlisted technical medical training in the Army, Air Force,
														and Navy to be co-located at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.
														As a result, four major learning institutions for Navy and Air Force relocated to Fort Sam Houston,
														where the Army was already training its enlisted medical force under the Army Medical Department Center and School (AMEDD C&S)
														Academy of Health Sciences. The Naval School of Health Sciences (NSHS) in San Diego, California;
														NSHS in Portsmouth, Virginia; Navy Hospital Corps School (NHCS) in Great Lakes, Illinois;
														and the 882d Training Group (Now the 59th TRG) at Sheppard Air Force Base moved to Fort Sam Houston.
														METC became the largest military medical education and training campus in the world.
