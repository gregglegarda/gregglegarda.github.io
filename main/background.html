												<h3>Early Memories</h3>
												<br>
												Too early for school.<br>
												When Gregg was 2 years old, his aunt wanted him to attend preschool but they didn't allow him beacause the minimum age was 3.
												They had to enroll him a semester later, when he was old enough.
												<br>
												Mascots<br>
												Gregg was explaining to other kids that mascots have people inside them.
												<br>
												Fun in the school bathroom<br>
												Gregg and his friend went to the bathroom at the same time "May I go out?" and when they met in the bathroom, they played with
												buckets of water, and both of them were soaking wet when they returned to class.
												<br>
												Fifth Birthday.<br>
												Someone asked how old he was on his birthday, he said four. The person said that he should be five because thats when the number goes up.
												Gregg then said.. "so next birthday, then ill be six?"
												<br>
												Santa Claus<br>
												Gregg didn't believe in Santa Claus. He keeps on over hearing that Santa Claus isn't real. One morning, a pair of shoes was
												on the top of the component sound system and his cousin and uncle said it was from santa. He said santa isn't real and that he saw
												the box in the trash can.
												<br>
												Trip to the train tracks<br>
												Gregg and his friend decided that one day, they would go on an adventure to follow where the train tracks would lead to.
												He ended up lost and was broad-casted in a local radio station.
