													Fisher Clinic is one of four branch medical clinics that are part of the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (FHCC).
													Originally named Naval Hospital Great Lakes Branch Medical and Dental Clinic,
													Bldg. 237 was renamed Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher Medical and Dental Clinic

													<h3>Laboratory Departments</h3>
													<b>Cytology</b>
													<p class="submeta">FHCC</p>
													<p style = 'margin:0;'>
													Evaluates the suitability of specimens for sectioning and staining, prepares specimens for analysis and ensures that proper conditions are maintained.
													This includes, but is not limited to, specimen accessioning, gross description dictation, slide preparation and staining.
													Processes and prepares all cytology specimens for diagnostic procedures while controlling physical conditions and responding to time factors to ensure that
													they physiological state of the specimen is maintained. This includes the use of centrifuges, cytocentrifuge, Thin Prep processor slide stainer, cell block methods, etc.
													Assures proper storage and maintenance of cytology records including slides and patient reports.
													Prepares reagent and control materials. Conducts quality control procedures on equipment, reagents and products,
													and maintains proper records for quality control reports.
													</p>
													<ul class="meta"></ul>

													<b>Hematology</b>
													<p class="submeta">FHCC</p>
													<p style = 'margin:0;'>
													Specialized in the testing and analysis of blood samples. Under the supervision of medical laboratory technologists,
													they run experiments on blood samples and write reports based on their findings.
													Their results can be used by physicians to diagnose various diseases and abnormalities,
													or by medical researchers to better understand a particular health condition.
													</p>
													<ul class="meta"></ul>

													<b>Microbiology</b>
													<p class="submeta">FHCC</p>
													<p style = 'margin:0;'>
													A Microbiological Laboratory Technician is tasked with aiding other microbiologists in their scientific research and work by doing technical tests,
													experiments, and other tasks. They help in many ways, such as aiding in the development of analyzing and testing processes and procedures
													or identification of microorganisms found in samples of liquids and substances, such as viruses and bacteria.
													They also do this by maintaining lab equipment, gathering samples, performing tests on microorganisms and samples, and reporting on the results.
													</p>
													<ul class="meta"></ul>

													<b>Chemistry</b>
													<p class="submeta">FHCC</p>
													<p style = 'margin:0;'>
													Is generally concerned with analysis of bodily fluids for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
													It is an applied form of biochemistry (not to be confused with medicinal chemistry, which involves basic research for drug development).
													The discipline originated in the late 19th century with the use of simple chemical reaction tests for various components of blood and urine.
													In the many decades since, other techniques have been applied as science and technology have advanced, including the use and measurement of enzyme activities,
													spectrophotometry, electrophoresis, and immunoassay. There are now many blood tests and clinical urine tests with extensive diagnostic capabilities.
													Most current laboratories are now highly automated to accommodate the high workload typical of a hospital laboratory.
													Tests performed are closely monitored and quality controlled.
													All biochemical tests come under chemical pathology. These are performed on any kind of body fluid, but mostly on serum or plasma.
													Serum is the yellow watery part of blood that is left after blood has been allowed to clot and all blood cells have been removed.
													This is most easily done by centrifugation, which packs the denser blood cells and platelets to the bottom of the centrifuge tube, leaving the liquid serum fraction resting above the packed cells.
													This initial step before analysis has recently been included in instruments that operate on the "integrated system" principle. Plasma is in essence the same as serum, but is obtained by centrifuging the blood without clotting. Plasma is obtained by centrifugation before clotting occurs. The type of test required dictates what type of sample is used.
													</p>
													<ul class="meta"></ul>

													<b>Urinalysis</b>
													<p class="submeta">FHCC</p>
													<p style = 'margin:0;'>
													Urinalysis, a portmanteau of the words urine and analysis, is a panel of medical tests that includes physical (macroscopic) examination of the urine,
													chemical evaluation using urine test strips, and microscopic examination. Macroscopic examination targets parameters such as color, clarity, odor, and specific gravity;
													urine test strips measure chemical properties such as pH, glucose concentration, and protein levels; and microscopy is performed to identify elements such as cells,
													urinary casts, crystals, and organisms.
													</p>
													<ul class="meta"></ul>

													<b>Coagulation</b>
													<p class="submeta">FHCC</p>
													<p style = 'margin:0;'>
													Blood clotting tests are the tests used for diagnostics of the hemostasis system. Coagulometer is the medical laboratory analyzer used for testing of the hemostasis system.
													Modern coagulometers realize different methods of activation and observation of development of blood clots in blood or in blood plasma.
													Substantially all coagulometers used in laboratory diagnostics are based on the methods of testing of the hemostasis system created more than fifty years ago.
													The majority of these methods are good to detect defects in one of the hemostasis components, without diagnosing other possible defects.
													Another problem of the actual hemostasis system diagnostics is the thrombosis prediction, i.e. sensitivity to the patient's prethrombotic state.
													All the diversity of clinical tests of the blood coagulation system can be divided into 2 groups: global (integral, general) tests, and local (specific) tests.
													</p>
													<ul class="meta"></ul>

													<b>Phlebotomy</b>
													<p class="submeta">FHCC</p>
													<p style = 'margin:0;'>
													Phlebotomy is the process of making a puncture in a vein, usually in the arm, with a cannula for the purpose of drawing blood.
													The procedure itself is known as a venipuncture, which is also used for intravenous therapy. A person who performs a phlebotomy is called a phlebotomist,
													although most doctors, nurses, and other technicians can also carry out a phlebotomy.
													Phlebotomies that are carried out in the treatment of some blood disorders are known as therapeutic phlebotomies.
													The average volume of whole blood drawn in a therapeutic phlebotomy to an adult is 1 unit (450-500 ml) weekly to once every several months, as needed.</p>
													<ul class="meta"></ul>

													<b>Blood Bank</b>
													<p class="submeta">FHCC</p>
													<p>
													A blood bank is a center where blood gathered as a result of blood donation is stored and preserved for later use in blood transfusion.
													The term "blood bank" typically refers to a division of a hospital where the storage of blood product occurs and where proper testing is performed
													(to reduce the risk of transfusion related adverse events). However, it sometimes refers to a collection center, and some hospitals also perform collection.
													Blood banking includes tasks related to blood collection, processing, testing, separation, and storage.
