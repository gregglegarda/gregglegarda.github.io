								<span class="image main"><img src="images/FHCC.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h4 class="major">Medical Laboratory Technology</h4> 
								I also worked as an ASCP Certified Medical Laboratory Technician (MLT) and a Cytologist Assistant in Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center in Great Lakes, IL from 2012 to 2015.<br />
								<br />
								Contributions:<br />
								<ul>
									<li>Designed and implemented a filing system for specimens, slides, and patient’s orders resulting in time savings from days and hours to seconds which also prevented patients from providing additional specimens for workup.</li>
									<li>Optimized specimen processing flow by implementing a system of procedures for technicians, resulting in time savings of half of the day’s work.</li>
									<li>Created a log of supply inventory for supplies to determine the approximate number of supplies needed to be ordered, which led to the reduction of the number of expired supplies needed to be thrown away.</li>
									<li>Trained a total of 9 employees to work in 6 different departments of the laboratory, contributing to the flexibility of the employees to work atdifferent areas of the laboratory when needed.</li>
								</ul>
								<br />	
									
									
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/US Navy.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h4 class="major">United States Navy Veteran</h4> 
								I decided to join and became a member of The United States Navy as a Hospital Corpsman (NEC: 0000, 8506) for 5 years starting from 2010 to 2015.

								<h4 class="major">Nonprofessional Jobs</h4>
								I also worked as kitchen staff, line cook, server and cashier at TA Country Pride Restaurant in Marianna Florida from 2009 to 2010.
								I then got a temporary job as an Inventory Specialist in Best Buy located at 14th st. in Washington, D.C. before I pursued my Bachelor's and Master's Degrees.<br />	
								<br />	
								<ul>
									<li>Volunteered to work overnight with the manager to organize the shelves in the back room. The efforts resulted in a better organized storage room which helped in a faster and more efficient way of obtaining products from the shelves.</li>
									<li>There was a lack of trained employees in the kitchen. There were constant sick calls from the kitchen leaving no one there and the manager had to come in to work in replacement of the employee. I took the initiative and volunteered to take over the kitchen jobs when we were undermanned.</li>
									<li>Took initiative on cleaning dirty areas of the kitchen and dining area. This Resulted in a cleaner, better looking atmosphere for both the employees and customers.</li>
									<li>High stress tolerance for emotionally taxing labor, a master at controlling emotions to show positive behavior throughout the job. Remains calm and stays positive at all times even when attacked with insults. Resulted in controlled situations and non- escalated situations. </li>
									<li>Great at dispute resolution. Can turn around heated situations into calm settings. Provided compensations when customers seem unsatisfied with their order (with the manager's discretion). Customers are more likely to come back for more business.</li>

								This application is a tool that analyzes and visualizes a dataset of US Accidents with 2.9 million observations and 49 features.
								It preprocesses the random sampled data in the back end which uses Imputation methods, Principal Component Analysis, Standard Scaler and Grid Search with Cross Validation.
								It also performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and displays histograms, correlograms, scatterplots and the summary of statistics of the variables.
								The tool enables the user to create models using different Machine Learning Algorithms and displays the model accuracy.
								The user can use the models to predict the severity of accidents that could happen when specific arguments are passed as parameters.
								The prediction uses machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, 
								Support Vector Machine and Linear regression. 
								PyQt was used for the Graphical User Interface along with a few lines of Java Script for the map visualization. 
								Folium was used for the geo map rendering with data points along with a Clustering algorithm to group data points with close coordinates.
								
								The approach taken was developing the code while testing all its working features at the same time in all possible orders. 
								Once a working feature is developed, the whole application is run and tested to ensure features are properly functioning.
								Fixes are made immediately upon discovery.

								Developed a program that classifies White Blood Cells (WBCs) to do differentials in the medical laboratory. It can provide a cheaper, faster, more accurate alternative to do manual differentials done by medical laboratory technicians.
								The application starts with the home screen having login buttons for patients and medical personnel.
								Medical personnel can be technicians or doctors. 
								Technicians are able to run new specimens using the machine learning classification algorithm that automatically classifies and counts the white blood cells.
								They can view the images, database, patient information and specimen results.
								Doctors are able to review cell images and comment on out-of-range specimen results.
								They finalize the result as normal or abnormal.
								Patients are able to view their results when matching patient information is entered.
								Used Python, Keras and TensorFlow to create machine learning models and PyQt for the Graphical User Interface.

								<h4 class="major" id = "project3">Instagram Facial Recognition</h4>

								Built a facial recognition application using Python and Plotly Dash that detects and recognizes faces in the webcam feed by using Haar Cascades and Histogram of Gradients (HOG) algorithms.
								The program also implements Web Scraping to pull information from Instagram and displays it on the screen. The program uses OpenCV, a computer vision package.
								The final application was a product of continuously building on top of the previous features. Starting from face detection from pictures, 
								video detection, live video detection, live video classification, web scraping, managing display, 
								and finally adding GUI functions like train model and different classifier algorithms (not shown in this video).

								Coded a program that approximates a given function using Machine Learning and Python by using early stopping techniques (comparing training and validation errors) to avoid overfitting of the model, and back propagation of sensitivities to update weights and biases.
								Program outputs number of epochs to determine how number of neurons in the hidden layer and learning rates affect convergence properties.
								The blue dotted line represents the given function and the red line represents the machine. The red line is initialized using random numbers and eventually will approximate the function given.

								Built a game called “Alien Attack” using Java and JFrame GUI components for the User Interface.
								Used Objects and Classes for creating the game and a Unified Modeling Language (UML) to create a diagram for visualizing the relationships, attributes and functions of the classes.

								The project approah was building an object oriented diagram plan before execution. 
								This plan was revised and changed as needed as the project progressed.

								<h4 class="major">Fuego Dance Team</h4>
								I was a member of Fuego, a latin dance team that performs Bachata, Cha-cha, and Salsa. Its purpose is to increase Latino cultural awareness through music and dance. 
								I had the opportunity to perform a dance called Bachata for the 24th Annual La Fiestasa. Many people audition but only a few get chosen.
								It requires a certain personality to commit to the intense pyhsically demanding practices of at least four times per week.

								<h4 class="major">Volunteer Events</h4>
								I participate in volunteer events from time to time.
								I volunteered at Meals on Wheels, Feed my Starving Children, Red Cross blood drives and donated blood. 
								I want to make a difference in the community even if it’s small ones. 
								I used to frequently do random good deeds but sometimes they backfire, 
								so I think volunteer events is a better way to serve the community.<br />
